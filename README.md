# Python-Projects

Although I have no idea if that will work (I hope it does) I just want to have a stable job in the future so I'll be a video game developer

Stuff I want to make:

- A game
- A shopping list that I can access on my phone
- A program that will remind me of stuff every few minutes, using notifications (Currently working on it and maybe even push it further and make it work on my phone.)
- A macro for a game (Idle Slayer)

I think that's it for now

Enjoy life
