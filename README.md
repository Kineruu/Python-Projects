# Python-Projects

Although I have no idea if that will work (I hope it does) I just want to have a stable job in the future so I'll be a video game developer

Stuff I want to make:

- A game
- A program that will remind me of stuff every few minutes, using notifications (Slowly finishing it)
- A calculator that will work

I think that's it for now

Enjoy life
