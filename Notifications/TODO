main.py: 

- Add history (A list with all notifications that were created)
- Add more functional buttons
- .exe file? Don't know how I'll do that though
- Update buttons size after clicking save (No clue if that's even possible but who knows)
    - I can change time and other stuff but not buttons width haha I'll try to fix that later

- Add more themes (That customtkinter allows)

- Maybe make the code cleaner by instead of having long lines of code split them into pieces?
