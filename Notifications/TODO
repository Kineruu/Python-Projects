main.py: 

- Redesign the buttons
 - Give them full display and maybe add a scrollwheel to go through all the notifications that are in NotificationsList folder?
 -> Make code cleaner
 -> Fix editing notification title not being updated after clicking save (I guess I'll do it when I'll be re-doing the buttons)
 -> Add random actions to the right side, such as changing the font? - just normal settings I guess?
 - Change the number at the end of the notification from number.txt to the amount of files in the folder + 1 I guess
 - Change buttons windows to not stack on each other but replace the current one with the new one and add a back button 
 - Add error handler
 - (Maybe) ask for feedback
 - Add another EntryBox asking the user what they want the file to be named (by default it'll be Notification{number}.json) (.json won't change.)

(Re-do this project because it's a mess)
