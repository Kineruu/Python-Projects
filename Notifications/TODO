- Make a TON of comments
- Consider switching the GUI library to something more modern and more flexible?

- Fix settings size
- Fix my goofy code
- Allow user to edit config.json through the application
- Move expired notifications to the inactive (Maybe I'll rename it in the upcoming future) category
