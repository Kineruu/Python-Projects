main.py: 

- Redesign the buttons
 - Give them full display and maybe add a scrollwheel to go through all the notifications that are in NotificationsList folder?
 -> Make code cleaner
 -> Fix editing notification title not being updated after clicking save (I guess I'll do it when I'll be re-doing the buttons)
 -> Remove the random space between Date and Hour entry boxes
 - Add a settings button in the top right corner
 - Change buttons windows to not stack on each other but replace the current one with the new one and add a back button 
 - Add error handler
 - (Maybe) ask for feedback
 - Add another EntryBox asking the user what they want the file to be named (by default it'll be Notification{number}.json) (.json won't change.)
