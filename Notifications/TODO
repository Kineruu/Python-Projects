main.py: 

- Add history (A list with all notifications that were created)
- Add more functional buttons
- .exe file? Don't know how I'll do that though
- Update buttons size after clicking save (No clue if that's even possible but who knows)
    - I can change time and other stuff but not buttons width haha I'll try to fix that later
- Make settings more readable
- Maybe add a little settings icon next to the buttons and let user change whatever with each button
- Yeah

- Add more themes (That customtkinter allows)
