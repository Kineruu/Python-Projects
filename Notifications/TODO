main.py: 

- Redesign the buttons
 - Give them full display and maybe add a scroolwheel to go through all the notifications that are in NotificationsList folder?
 - Make code cleaner
 - Add error handler
 - (Maybe) ask for feedback
 - Make buttons and other stuff always in their place no matter what size is the window (sorry for bad English)
 - Add another EntryBox asking the user what they want the file to be named (by default it'll be Notification{number}.json) (.json won't change.)
