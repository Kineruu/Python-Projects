Present the solution (source code) to the students


3-4.
Create a structure named Course that represents a course, and contains the following members:
 courseName: a string that represents the name of the course
 courseGrade: a float that represents the code of the course
Create a structure named Student that represents a student, and contains the following members:
 studentName: a string that represents the name of the student
 studentID: an integer that represents the ID of the student
 numC ( an integer for the number of courses)
 courses, an array of type Course
 function named readStudent that prints the name, ID, and grade of the student.
 function named printStudent that prints the name, ID, and grade of the student.
 function float calculateAverage, that calculates the average grade from all courses.

Finally, create a main function that creates a Student object, and calls the readStudent to populate it
with students and grades, and printStudent function to display the student and courses information
and also prints the average grade.
