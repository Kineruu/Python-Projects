# No clue if I'll use png or write a gui for it
# Imagine having 9x9 board with 3x3 subgrids using Entry boxes hahahahhahah
# That would be cruel, no?
# Who knows
# I'll probably just use a png and write a solver for it
# Will be quicker and less annoying to use Entry boxes
# I'll probably use a library for the png
# I'll probably use PIL for the png
# I'll probably use numpy for the solver
# I'll probably use tkinter for the gui
# I'll probably use pygame for the gui
# No I'm not going schizophrenic
# I'm just thinking out loud
# I'm not even thinking out loud
# I'm just typing out loud
# I'm not even typing out loud
# I'm just typing
# I'm not even typing
# I'm just pressing buttons
# I'm not even pressing buttons
# I'm just pressing keys
# I'm not even pressing keys
# I'm just pressing
# I'm not even pressing
# I'm just
# I'm not even
# I'm
# I'm not

# I'm not even sure what I'm doing anymore
# Life MAN
